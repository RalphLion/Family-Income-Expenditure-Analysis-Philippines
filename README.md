The data was initially cleaned and processed using Excel to prepare it for analysis. Subsequently, SQL (BigQuery) was employed for in-depth data analysis, leveraging its capabilities for querying and processing large datasets. The analyzed insights were then visualized using Power BI, providing intuitive and interactive visualizations to enhance understanding and presentation of the findings.

## Tools Used:
* Excel: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
